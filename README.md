üåü Embarking on my journey in the world of technology, I'm currently in a Computer Science degree at my university. With a CGPA of 3.27, I‚Äôm dedicated to enhancing it to a 3.50+ as I pursue my passion for Software Engineering. My academic experiences have been bolstered by a wide array of courses, from C++ and Java to SQL and HTML, providing me with a solid foundation in both programming and problem-solving. üöÄ<br><br>‚ú® My hands-on experience includes developing a car management system using Java, a hotel management system employing SQL, and crafting a project marketplace in C#. Additionally, I've created approximately eight engaging websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, experiencing the powerful intersection of creativity and code.<br><br>Beyond code, I dive into the realm of storytelling through video editing on Da Vinci Resolve. Editing is a passion I‚Äôve explored through creating montages for my YouTube channel, merging my technical and creative skills. üé•<br><br>ü§ù Always curious and driven, I am looking to connect with like-minded individuals and experienced professionals. If you share my enthusiasm for technology, or if you're simply intrigued by my journey, I welcome you to my network.
